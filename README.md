### ‚ö° About Me

- I enjoy diving into systems programming and bringing robust solutions to the web.
- Open to collaborating on innovative open source projects.
- Always happy to chat about code, games, or the latest in tech.

Note: there are not finished projects in my repos, thats because i did them only for practice, no intention of finishing them, maybe i will do it once, but not now xD
